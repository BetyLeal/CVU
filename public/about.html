<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am a 22-year-old person who is currently studying industrial engineering. I am passionate about the world of problem solving and process optimization. I'm always looking for ways to do things more efficiently and effectively.

<p>Outside of academia, I have a great interest in physical exercise. I firmly believe in the importance of staying active to take care of my health and well-being. Additionally, I find exercise to be a great way to clear my mind and improve my concentration on my studies.

<p>Another of my great tastes is music. I enjoy exploring different genres and artists, and music has become an integral part of my daily life. Whether it's to relax or motivate myself during a workout, I always find music to be a source of inspiration.
